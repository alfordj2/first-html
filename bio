<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>tep into my office.

Execution is, by Layman, an art. The human race sips expression through a straw because there is no wide-angle lens that could capture the world as it exists in the minds of each individual master. Execution is taking that straw and cutting it down the middle to expose its secrets to businessmen and engineers and politicians whose art is reflected in their accomplishments.<br><br>
I am the master of none and my straw is a telescope and a pen and a camera and a stylus. <br><br>

I am a graphic design student at The College of New Jersey.<br><br>

I regularly touch Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator; I'm well acquainted with the entire Microsoft Office Suite and AutoDesk Maya; my best friends, however, are my hands that could change the world if I let them--don't worry, I keep my wrists under constant watch.
<br><br>
It is with great pleasure that I present to you a small sampling of my work I have gathered. If you have any questions, I am available for contact at alfordj2@tcnj.edu. If you so desire, you can also take a look at my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=285728526&goback=%2Enmp_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1&trk=spm_pic" title="My LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>.

Thank you for coming.</p>
