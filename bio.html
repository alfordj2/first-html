<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Step into my office.
<br><br>

I am a graphic design student at The College of New Jersey.<br><br>

I regularly touch Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator; I'm well acquainted with the entire Microsoft Office Suite and AutoDesk Maya; my best friends, however, are my hands that could change the world if I let them--don't worry, I keep my wrists under constant watch.
<br><br>
It is with great pleasure that I present to you a small sampling of my work I have gathered. If you have any questions, I am available for contact at alfordj2@tcnj.edu. If you so desire, you can also take a look at my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=285728526&goback=%2Enmp_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1&trk=spm_pic" title="My LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>.
<br><br>
Thank you for coming.</p>
